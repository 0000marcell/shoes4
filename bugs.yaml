  title: For 'password' mode, accept :secret style for Ask dialog?
  desc: |+
    
    edit_line can take a style of :secret => TRUE for obscured input.
    
    Could the Ask dialog also take a :secret setting?
    
    Use_case: ask("What is your Credit Card PIN?", :secret => TRUE)
    
    results in - What is your Credit Card PIN? [**** ]
    
    Or, since the dialogs only accept a single argument for simplicity, have an 'ask_obscured' variant of the dialog.

  title: alignment of text blocks
  desc: "\n\
    Win32, Revision 258. Using this tiny app for testing:\n\n\
    Shoes.app do\n\
    banner \"banner\"\n\
    title \"title\"\n\
    subtitle \"subtitle\"\n\
    tagline \"tagline\"\n\
    caption \"caption\"\n\
    para \"para\"\n\
    inscription \"inscription\"\n\
    end\n\n\
    steps to reproduce \xC2\xB6\n\n\
    start with full width window, everything looks as expected. now start to make it smaller (in width)\n\n\
    * inscription wraps when the window is at ri (in the middle of the word), should wrap at the end\n\
    * when wrapping, it is not below banner but right in the (vertical) middle of \"ba\"\n\
    * para wraps at the right position (window-size)\n\
    * x position of inscription after wrapping of para is correct but inscription is at y=0\n\n\
    ... and so on.\n\
    Results \xC2\xB6\n\n\
    Everything but \"para\" wraps too late.\n\n\
    valign is a mess - couldn't identify the problem just by adding some fields and resizing\n\n"

  title: don't allow elements to be added without at least an `append`
  desc: |+
    
    Well, the code should be:
    
    Shoes.app do
    button "add para" do
    append { para "here" }
    end
    end
    
    Adding the element without an append should throw an error.
