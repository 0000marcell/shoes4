title: For 'password' mode, accept :secret style for Ask dialog?
desc: |+
  
  edit_line can take a style of :secret => TRUE for obscured input.
  
  Could the Ask dialog also take a :secret setting?
  
  Use_case: ask("What is your Credit Card PIN?", :secret => TRUE)
  
  results in - What is your Credit Card PIN? [**** ]
  
  Or, since the dialogs only accept a single argument for simplicity, have an 'ask_obscured' variant of the dialog.
