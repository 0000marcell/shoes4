title: Simple menus

  A first take at menu support in Shoes. Likely this would only activate in
  standalone mode.
  
  menu "File" do
  menu("(O)pen...") { ask_open_file }
  menu("(A)bout")   { about_dialog }
  bar
  menu("E(x)it") { close }
  end
  
  Something like that.
  
  Also, add the status bar, if anyone wants to use it.
