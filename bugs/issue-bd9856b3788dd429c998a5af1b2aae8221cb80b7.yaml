title: Binject problems on OS X when building EXEs
desc: |-
  > 2. In Raisins, running on Windows XP, the packager fails properly
  > create an EXE for source code containing windows line returns.
  >
  > As far as I can tell, the packager is removing all "\r"s from the
  > source files being added to the EXE. However, the length of the file
  > is not adjusted, resulting in an extra byte of garbage for each "\r"
  > appended to the source file when decompressed by Shoes for execution.
  >
  > The user sees a message like "Illegal characters \312 \112 ..." in the
  > shoes console when trying to execute the EXE.
