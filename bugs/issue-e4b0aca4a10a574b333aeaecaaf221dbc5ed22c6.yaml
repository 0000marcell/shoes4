title: alignment of text blocks
desc: "\n\
  Win32, Revision 258. Using this tiny app for testing:\n\n\
  Shoes.app do\n\
  banner \"banner\"\n\
  title \"title\"\n\
  subtitle \"subtitle\"\n\
  tagline \"tagline\"\n\
  caption \"caption\"\n\
  para \"para\"\n\
  inscription \"inscription\"\n\
  end\n\n\
  steps to reproduce \xC2\xB6\n\n\
  start with full width window, everything looks as expected. now start to make it smaller (in width)\n\n\
  * inscription wraps when the window is at ri (in the middle of the word), should wrap at the end\n\
  * when wrapping, it is not below banner but right in the (vertical) middle of \"ba\"\n\
  * para wraps at the right position (window-size)\n\
  * x position of inscription after wrapping of para is correct but inscription is at y=0\n\n\
  ... and so on.\n\
  Results \xC2\xB6\n\n\
  Everything but \"para\" wraps too late.\n\n\
  valign is a mess - couldn't identify the problem just by adding some fields and resizing\n\n"
