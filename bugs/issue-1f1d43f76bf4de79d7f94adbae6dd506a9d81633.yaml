title: Scrolling windows and fixed height slot have a white background -- what about transparent?
desc: |
  Fixed height containers, at current, unavoidably have a background. _why has hardcoded that background to "white" until the problem can be worked out.
  Here is the test code:
  
  Shoes.app do
  background green
  stack :width => 100 do
  border black
  para "Stack #1", :stroke => red
  end
  stack :width => 100, :height => 100 do
  border black
  para "Stack #2", :stroke => red
  end
  end
  
  Stack #1 is transparent, Stack #2 is white.
  
  You can deviate from the default with an explicit "background" command, but transparency stops being an option.

  - Transparent scroll windows are working on all three platforms now.  The trickiest of these was GTK, which required me to switch to a GtkFixed widget and use clipping on the cairo surface.
