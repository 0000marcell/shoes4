title: An `upload` method
desc: |-
  Analogous to the `download` method. I had proposed an `upload_form` method
  as well, but the shoes list made a good point that I could just duck type
  whether a String, IO or Hash is sent to upload.
  
  A very simple form of it would be to POST a file to a URL.
  
  upload "/tmp/body.post", :to => "http://www.stevex.net/dump.php"
