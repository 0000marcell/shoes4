title: Give text a `rotate` method and style.
desc: |
  Like images, I'd like text blocks to have a `rotate` method.  And the ability to rotate when styled like so:
  para "Sideways", :rotate => 90
  
  One thing to consider is how this naming is confusing as gradients are effected by an `angle` style.
