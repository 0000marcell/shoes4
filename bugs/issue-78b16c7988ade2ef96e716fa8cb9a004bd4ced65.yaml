title: don't allow elements to be added without at least an `append`
desc: |+
  
  Well, the code should be:
  
  Shoes.app do
  button "add para" do
  append { para "here" }
  end
  end
  
  Adding the element without an append should throw an error.

  - This was fixed a few checkins ago.  Instead of disallowing it, I allowed it and fixed the segfault.  So, elements can be added with or without `append`.
