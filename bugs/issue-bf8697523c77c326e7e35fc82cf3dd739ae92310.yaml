title: add-scale the height or width of an image if only one dimension is supplied
desc: "It would be nice if image(), when given a width,                                             \n\
  or a height, but not both, would size the image to that width/height, and                                             \n\
  size the other dimension automatically to maintain aspect ratio. For                                                  \n\
  example:                                                                                                              \n\n\
  If I had a png which is 500x1000 pixels big, and I do image('bigpony.png',                                            \n\
  :width => 200), it would size height to 400."
