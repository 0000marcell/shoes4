title: add-scale the height or width of an image if only one dimension is supplied
desc: |-
  It would be nice if image(), when given a width,                                             
  or a height, but not both, would size the image to that width/height, and                                             
  size the other dimension automatically to maintain aspect ratio. For                                                  
  example:                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                        
  If I had a png which is 500x1000 pixels big, and I do image('bigpony.png',                                            
  :width => 200), it would size height to 400.
