title: Negative stack heights inside pages misbehave
desc: |+
  
  Once a working stack (with flows and stacks inside) with negative height code is inserted inside a page, good rendering stops.
  
  No workaround found yet. Tried: - put everything inside a stack :height => 1.0, :width => 1.0 - put everything inside a stack :height => 300, :width => 500 (no relative dimensions)
  
  Using our negative height stack inside those cases doesnt work either.
